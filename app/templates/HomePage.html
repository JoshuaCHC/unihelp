<h1>SAFETY IS NEVER AN ACCIDENT</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Unisafe!</h2>
<h3> As older university students we have realised that there was a lack of information
  provided to us about university when we were first year students. This is why we created UniSafe
  where this information is provided to students in a fun and interesting manner.
