<h1>SAFETY IS NEVER AN ACCIDENT</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Unisafe!</h2>
<h3>To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
  Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
  No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
  For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
  Big iron on his hip
  It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
  He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
  He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
  And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
  Big iron on his hip
  In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
  Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
  He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
  And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
  One and 19 more</h3>
