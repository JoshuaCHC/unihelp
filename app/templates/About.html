      <h1>GENERAL CAMPUS HEALTH + SAFETY</h1>
      <h2>Staying Safe, Healthy, and Happy!</h2>

      <h3>WHAT ARE WE TEACHING?</h3>
      <hr style="width:8em">
      <p>Uni-Safe explores various aspects of university health and safety, teaching important 
          skills, tips, and tricks! <br>
          Our modules cover interactive online CPR training, the do's and dont's surrounding 
          alcohol consumption in a university setting, and how to use UWA's resources to 
          prioritise your health and safety in order to gain the uni-experience of your dreams.
      </p>
      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>We are a team of UWA students each in different stages of our individual degree plans. 
          Between the four of us, we have learnt many lessons over our time at UWA, which includes 
          an accumulative 7+ years of living on campus.<br>
          When it comes to campus life, and the importance staying safe and healthy has on one's 
          overall uni success, we have a lot to say.<br>
          <i>Our purpose</i> is to use our own experiences to educate other UWA students on the actions 
          you can take to increase your safety. We educate with the aim to encourage students to 
          make this a priority and reduce the risk of future mishaps that could potentially be 
          fatal for your studies, or even...life.
